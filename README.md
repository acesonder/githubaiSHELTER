AUTOMATE SHELTER SYSTEM PLATFORMS 

For a platform like OUTSINC, which is designed to support individuals facing sensitive situations such as homelessness, addiction, and mental health challenges, the front-end UI/UX should be empathetic, intuitive, and empowering while maintaining a modern and visually appealing aesthetic. Here's a breakdown of the recommended UI/UX interface:
